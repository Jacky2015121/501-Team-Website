     <fromt>Ethical issues- Jacky</fromt>
    </h3>
  <p>I feel More and more industries are connected with information technology, and the scope of computer technology is also increasingly extensive, which makes network security particularly important. For example, as a user, when I need to enter a game, some games require my personal information. Due to the violence in the game, it is necessary to confirm whether the player is over 18 years old to play the game. At this time, users need to be self-disciplined. The security contract will also be displayed on the interface at this time. I feel a little insecure. Whether the so-called security contract is useful and whether outsiders have the authority to clear and modify your information, especially when you need to pay. I think a sound legal contract can better protect the relationship between link users and network operators. In conclusion,  I want to say that it is not 100% secure on the internet,  but we can reduce the risk by creating a better network environment, such as telling young people of the negative impact of the network earlier, and how to confirm whether the network is malicious and build a good network cognition. more importantly to improve better cybersecurity to use. In addition, Operators should use better network security technicians but constantly update their vulnerabilities and ensure that all personnel who have taken over the procedures have good ethics and do not leak from the inside. </p>

     <fromt>Personal reflections- Jacky</fromt>
    </h3>
  <p>Based on that kind of situation, we decide to use cybersecurity as our topic. In this grouping activity, we mainly understand the application scope of network security. The goal of computer security is to protect assets and information. Therefore, we introduced these possible problems and explained how to protect them. In practice,  I mainly helped to check some information and put it in the team chat, and made some PPT content. I am also nervous about the speech. So my team members are responsible for speaking.  I donâ€™t know how to use GitHub, so my group mate made the main web. I just send the documents we need to them. I recommend that we should have more meeting times so we can finish our work earlier.</p>
